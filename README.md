=======================

Compile the code:
-Open up catwalk.pro in QT and press Build.

Special Instruction: 
-To get stretching working, divide the default Stretching K by 10.
-Since you have to divide StretchingK by 10, you should also divide BendingK by 10 so that the forces are consistent

Things that dont work properly:
-Stretching breaks on collision with the default settings
-Object movement/rotation works sometimes and breaks sometimes
